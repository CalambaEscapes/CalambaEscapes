                        Religious activities are an integral part of Calamba’s festivals and events. The Feast of Patron Saint Isidore, also called San Isidro Labrador, the city’s patron saint, is celebrated with great fervor and devotion. This religious event brings together the Catholic community of Calamba, which pays homage to Saint Isidore, the patron saint of farmers and laborers.
                        <br><br>
                        The Feast of Patron Saint Isidore is marked by religious processions, novena masses, and a grand fiesta. Devotees gather at the Calamba Cathedral to offer their prayers and seek blessings for their livelihoods. The religious activities during this festival create a strong sense of community and provide a space for spiritual reflection and renewal.
